NOTE: YOU MUST HAVE JAVA 7 INSTALLED TO RUN THIS PROGRAM

To Run:
There are two "run" batch files included with this zip:

run.bat - This batch file simply runs the "java" command. To use it, you must have java's bin directory added to your computer's environment variables.

run_alt.bat - This batch file runs the "java" command by navigating directly to the java runtime bin folder. The directory in quotes in the run_alt.bat file MUST be the directory of your own jre7. The directory should be formatted like this:
"C:\Program Files\<your java runtime directory>\bin\java" with quotes.
By default, run_alt.bat contains my jre7 directory. Yours might be different. If it is, navigate to your jre7 directory and replace the filepath in the run_alt.bat file with your own filepath. Make sure to follow the format above. 

Buttons:
A - Enter / Z
B - Spacebar / X
DPad - Arrow Keys / WASD

You can edit these in the options menu
